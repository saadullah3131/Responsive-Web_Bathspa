                <h2>Iftikhar A Khan | Program Leader, Creative Computing</h2>
                <br />
                <p>It is as interesting as it is deceptive, how certain professions are hard-termed “technical”; as if
                    they are purely mechanical/manual, with no requisite to use one’s brain & creativity; almost
                    equaling it to “breaking stones”. But think of his breaking stones scenario for a moment. Do you
                    think one can break stones efficiently for a long time without using brain...or for that matter,
                    being creative? In fact you will quickly realize; once you imagine yourself given a task to break
                    100 stones into smaller pieces over a day (manually or mechanically); that it is not enough to have
                    just adequate energy and good tools to do the job most efficiently. You will see that it will take
                    substantial engagement, understanding the problem at hand, considering several approaches,
                    implementing an approach, testing the result & continued iteration, until the problem is solved most
                    proficiently, consistently. In this case, breaking all 100 stones in into required size pieces, most
                    efficiently with a sense of system that can be repeated endlessly.</p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    You may find this interesting to see how the above “thinking pattern”; which is typically earmarked
                    for the elite “design thinking & creative” tasks; applies to even the most mundane (not so of
                    course) of the jobs.

                    <br /><br />Coding is one of these tasks; where we typically visualize a coder typing vehemently on
                    a computer; reducing coding to a skill of the hands…with hardly or no engagement of the mind!!
                    Whereas it can’t be any further from the truth as we can see with the example above.

                    <br /> <br /> Coding starts exactly where every small & big inventions of the world come from…the
                    human mind. It is a mental skill that is manifested with manual & digital tools. In fact a major
                    part of coding is mental that requires “adequate engagement, understanding the problem at hand,
                    considering several approaches, implementing an approach, testing the result; & continued iteration
                    until the problem is solved most efficiently & consistently.”
